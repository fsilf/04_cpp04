* Polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces

** Polymorphism
References:


A polymorphic class is a class that defines or inherits at least one virtual function.

*** Polymorphic classes and public copy/move
- [[https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#c67-a-polymorphic-class-should-suppress-public-copymove][A polymorphic class should suppress public copy/move]]

A polymorphic class is a class that defines or inherits at least one virtual function. It is likely that it will be used as a base class for other derived classes with polymorphic behavior. If it is accidentally passed by value, with the implicitly generated copy constructor and assignment, we risk slicing: only the base portion of a derived object will be copied, and the polymorphic behavior will be corrupted.

If the class has no data, =delete the copy/move functions. Otherwise, make them protected.

#+begin_src cpp
  class B { // GOOD: polymorphic class suppresses copying
  public:
      B() = default;
      B(const B&) = delete;
      B& operator=(const B&) = delete;
      virtual char m() { return 'B'; }
      // ...
  };

  class D : public B {
  public:
      char m() override { return 'D'; }
      // ...
  };

  void f(B& b)
  {
      auto b2 = b; // ok, compiler will detect inadvertent copying, and protest
  }

  D d;
  f(d);
#+end_src

If you need to create deep copies of polymorphic objects, use ~clone()~ functions: see C.130.

**** Exception objects
Classes that represent exception objects need both to be polymorphic and copy-constructible.

**** Enforcement
- Flag a polymorphic class with a public copy operation.
- Flag an assignment of polymorphic class objects.


*** For polymorphic classes provide a virtual clone function if copy is needed

Copying a polymorphic class is discouraged due to the slicing problem, see [[https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rc-copy-virtual][C.67]]. If you really need copy semantics, copy deeply: Provide a ~virtual clone~ function that will copy the actual most-derived type and return an owning pointer to the new object, and then in derived classes return the derived type (use a covariant return type).

Note: Covariant return types allow overridden virtual member functions in a derived class to return a different type of object, as long as it can be used in all the same ways as the base class's return type.

- protected copy constructor and assignment operator
- public virtual clone method

#+begin_src cpp
  class Base
  {
  public:
    virtual Base* Clone() = 0;
  };

  class Derivedn : public Base
  {
  public:
    //This is OK, its called covariant return type.
    Derivedn* Clone()
    {
      return new Derivedn(*this);
    }
  private:
    Derivedn(const Derivedn&) : ... {}
  };
#+end_src

  ,#+begin_src cpp
    class B {
    public:
	B() = default;
	virtual ~B() = default;
	virtual gsl::owner<B*> clone() const = 0;
    protected:
	 B(const B&) = default;
	 B& operator=(const B&) = default;
	 B(B&&) = default;
	 B& operator=(B&&) = default;
	// ...
    };

    class D : public B {
    public:
	gsl::owner<D*> clone() const override
	{
	    return new D{*this};
	};
    };

** Methods
*** Virtual Member Functions (Methods)
References:
- [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/virtual][cpp reference - virtual function specifier]]

 Virtual functions are member functions whose behavior can be overridden in derived classes. As opposed to non-virtual functions, the overriding behavior is preserved even if there is no compile-time information about the actual type of the class. That is to say, if a derived class is handled using pointer or reference to the base class, a call to an overridden virtual function would invoke the behavior defined in the derived class. Such a function call is known as virtual function call or virtual call.
 
  
*** Virtual Destructors
References:
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/10026522][Stack - C++ Virtual functions but no virtual destructors]]
- [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/virtual][cpp - virtual function specifier]]
- [[https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#c35-a-base-class-destructor-should-be-either-public-and-virtual-or-protected-and-non-virtual][C++ CoreGuidelines - A base class destructor should be either public and virtual, or protected and non-virtual]]
  
A useful guideline is that the destructor of any base class must be public and virtual or protected and non-virtual, whenever delete expressions are involved:

To prevent undefined behavior. If the destructor is public, then calling code can attempt to destroy a derived class object through a base class pointer, and the result is undefined if the base class's destructor is non-virtual. If the destructor is protected, then calling code cannot destroy through a base class pointer and the destructor does not need to be virtual; it does need to be protected, not private, so that derived destructors can invoke it. In general, the writer of a base class does not know the appropriate action to be done upon destruction.

** Abstract Classes
References:
- [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/abstract_class][cppreference - Abstract classes]]

Defines an abstract type which cannot be instantiated, but can be used as a base class.

*** Syntax
A pure virtual function is a virtual function whose declarator has the following syntax:

#+begin_src c++
declarator virt-specifier(optional) = 0 		
#+end_src

Here the sequence = 0 is known as pure-specifier, and appears either immediately after the declarator or after the optional virt-specifier (override or final).

pure-specifier cannot appear in a member function definition or friend declaration.

An abstract class is a class that either defines or inherits at least one function for which the final overrider is pure virtual.

*** Explanation
Abstract classes are used to represent general concepts (for example, Shape, Animal), which can be used as base classes for concrete classes (for example, Circle, Dog).

No objects of an abstract class can be created (except for base subobjects of a class derived from it) and no non-static data members whose type is an abstract class can be declared.

Pointers and references to an abstract class can be declared.

Making a virtual call to a pure virtual function from a constructor or the destructor of the abstract class is undefined behavior (regardless of whether it has a definition or not).

** Interfaces
References:
- [[https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rh-abstract][CPP Core Guidelines - If a base class is used as an interface, make it a pure abstract class]]

A class is more stable (less brittle) if it does not contain data. Interfaces should normally be composed entirely of public pure virtual functions and a default/empty virtual destructor.

** The Rule of Three
Reference:
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28C++_programming%29][Wikipedia - The Rule of three]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16752850/assignment-operator-and-deep-copy][Stack - Assignment operator and deep copy]]

The rule of three (also known as the law of the big three or the big three) is a rule of thumb in C++ (prior to C++11) that claims that if a class defines any of the following then it should probably explicitly define all three:
- destructor
- copy constructor
- copy assignment operator

Because implicitly-generated constructors and assignment operators simply copy all class data members ("shallow copy"), one should define explicit copy constructors and copy assignment operators for classes that encapsulate complex data structures or have external references such as pointers, if you need to copy the objects pointed to by the class members.

*** Initializing an array

**** How to initialize an "empty" array
References: [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array_initialization][cppreference - Array initialization]]

To initialize an empty array:
#+begin_src
my_array[10] = {}
#+end_src

*** Override specifier cpp11
References:
- [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/override][cppreference - override specifier]]

Specifies that a virtual function overrides another virtual function

*** Default specifier cpp11
Reference:
- [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_constructor][cppreference - Default connstructors]]

A default constructor is a constructor which can be called with no arguments (either defined with an empty parameter list, or with default arguments provided for every parameter).

#+begin_src cpp
class-name () = default;
#+end_src

With the default specifier the compiler will define the implicit default constructor even if other constructors are present.
